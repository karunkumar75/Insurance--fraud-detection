# Insurance--fraud-detection
Insurance Company working as commercial enterprise from last few years have been experiencing fraud cases for all type of claims. Amount claimed by fraudulent is significantly huge that may cause serious problems, hence along with government, different organization also working to detect and reduce such activities.. These fraudulent practices undermine the integrity of insurance claim processes and necessitate the development of robust systems to address them effectively. In response to the escalating threat of insurance fraud, the aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive system capable of analyzing vast datasets of insurance claims to detect fraudulent and fake claims. 

     Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, support vector machine, logistic regression, na√Øve bayes, stochastic gradient descent algorithms, the project seeks to construct models that can accurately label and classify claims based on their fraudulent nature. The project aims to empower insurance companies with the tools necessary to proactively identify suspicious claims and mitigate potential losses.
